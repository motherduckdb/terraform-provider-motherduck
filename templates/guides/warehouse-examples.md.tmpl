# Warehouse examples

Start with the [example overview](../../examples/warehouses/README.md).
The examples use separate service accounts for environments, as recommended in
[MotherDuck resource management](https://motherduck.com/docs/concepts/resource-management).

| Example | What it builds |
| --- | --- |
| [Identity bootstrap](../../examples/warehouses/bootstrap/README.md) | Separate dev/prod writer and BI service accounts |
| [Simple warehouse](../../examples/warehouses/simple/README.md) | Orders table and daily revenue view in one database |
| [Layered warehouse](../../examples/warehouses/layered/README.md) | Raw, transformation, and materialized marts with restricted BI sharing |

Apply identities first using admin credentials. Deploy warehouses afterward
using the appropriate writer token, independent environment state, and variables.
An environment label does not change the authenticated owner.

SQL templates and manifests document model dependencies. Terraform manages
definitions; ingestion and data refresh run outside Terraform. The examples
create no Flight executions, Dives, or Guides.

Examples validate and plan offline in the supported CLI matrix. Embedded DuckDB
tests execute their SQL and assert deduplication, cancellation filtering, exact
decimal totals, repeatable refresh, and empty-input behavior. Cross-account
permissions still need a live check with the intended writer and reader tokens.

These are copyable starting points. Review state security, token rotation,
table replacement, retention, source-quality checks, and cleanup order before
using them for production data.
